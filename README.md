Illumio Coding Assignment:

1. The code can be made more efficient using different data structures or algorithm. If more time was given I would have included more test cases for handling error or incorrect input.

2. Since time complexity is an important part of any algorithm. Using correct data structures and algorithm is important for managing the time complexity.
This algorithm gives us theta (1) runtime.

##  Team Preference
1. Data Team
2. Platform Team
